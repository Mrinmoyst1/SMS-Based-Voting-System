# Code-Horizon
SMS based advanced voting system using Python and NodeMCU
This project was actually done for competing in the intra-departmental project competition and the project got first prize. 
You will need:
1. Python for main code
2. Arduino to program NodeMCU
3. GSM Module : I have used Air200. This is low price and comparitively good.
